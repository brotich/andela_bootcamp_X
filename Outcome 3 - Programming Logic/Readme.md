## Day 0: Start of Bootcamp
This folder contains the code for `fibonacci` and `prime numbers` assignments written on the first day of bootcamp

[`tests`](./tests) folder contains the tests used in developing solutions for both assignments.

***
[`fibonacci.py`](./fibonacci.py) generates the first `n` numbers of the fibonacci series as a list

[`prime_numbers.py`](./prime_numbers.py) generates the prime numbers from `0` to `n` as a list
